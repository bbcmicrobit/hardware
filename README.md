# BBC micro:bit

## Open hardware designs

This repository contains the schematics and bill of materials for the BBC
micro:bit.

## Technical documentation for the BBC micro:bit

The main technical documentation for the BBC micro:bit lives at the [micro:bit Tech Site](https://tech.microbit.org/).
On that site, you will find details about the way the micro:bit works, a
reference-design based on the micro:bit, as well as a detailed walk-through of
the schematic contained in this repository.

* [Overview of the hardware](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/).
* [Walk-through of the schematic](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/schematic/).
* [A reference-design based on the micro:bit](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/reference-design/)
which includes layout and gerbers and is based on a module for easy fabrication.

### Versions

There are two versions of the BBC micro:bit board that have been produced, V1.3
and V1.5. V1.5 was created to address the end-of-life of the micro:bit's motion
sensors.

There are more details about the V1.5 revision on the
[micro:bit Knowledge Base motion sensor revision article](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000087020-micro-bit-motion-sensor-hardware-change).

### Differences from manufactured BBC micro:bits

These versions differ slightly from that used in manufacturing the original
micro:bit, in that trademarks (which are licensed separately) have been
removed.
